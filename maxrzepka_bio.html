<h2 id="sec-2">2000 Graduate in Mathematics (Probability) at University Paris Curie VI</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
I started my education in pure math in Paris VI. But I found pure math very dry.
I found it difficult to decide which direction to go in for my PhD.
I needed something more applied.
</p>
<p>
I chose Geography : looking at maps, understanding how the world is turning around is the most natural thing for me.
Just one month after starting, we were sent out in the field (Forêt de Fontainebleau studying stampian sand)
By choosing Geography, I came across new horizons such as Statistics and Unix operating systems.
</p>
<p>
I went back to math, but this time more applied : statistics and probability.
</p>
<p>
I did a trainership at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis and enjoyed my first programming experience with C and pointers.
The algorithm I developed detects roads from satellite maps.
It was fairly fast, but lacked of well-grounded mathematical proof.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
In the meantime I was offered a scholarship for a PhD in probability in Paris.
After one year I realized that it would not work out as the material was too pure.
I was more interested in Computer Science but I could not find a bridge between the fields.
</p>
<p>
However I did get the opportunity to do some teaching and it was a really great experience :
The best way to learn is by teaching.

<h2 id="sec-4">2003 - 2006 : Java/SQL Contractor in Paris</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
After a 2 months Java/SQL training, I started a new career inside the enterprise IT world.
My missions were in Java, SQL, Oracle. All projects were built on the common three-tier architecture (mostly web-apps).
</p>
<p>
Some projects were using more "advanced" frameworks like Hibernate, Struts.
I also always kept a personal interest for the unix world (vi,awk, perl and co).

<h2 id="sec-5">2006 - 2013 : Programmer at Interactive Brokers in Zug</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


<p>
My role was to collect data in order to build reports and more advanced web based applications to ease employee work.
The technologies in place were restricted : Perl, PHP , Java (Spring, JSF) , Javascript , Oracle/MySQL, still in a complete unix environment.
</p>
<p>
This long period in a stable environment allowed me to try new ideas and to find solutions to my day-to-day issues :
</p><ul>
<li>Code generation to write boilerplate code in various languages.
</li>
<li>Web development in java with Spring and JSF.
</li>
<li>Web User Interface in Javascript with JQuery.
</li>
<li>Scripting tools : awk , perl&hellip;
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sec-6">Clojure revolution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">


<p>
I discovered Clojure in 2010.
I slowly made my own revolution leaving Object Oriented Paradigms that I always find difficult to get right,
and entering the world of data and functions, paradigms which are much easier for me to grasp.
</p>
<p>
I got really enthusiastic about this functional language thanks to Rich Hickey and Stuart Halloway's Talks :
The clojure version of The bowling scorer <a href="https://github.com/stuarthalloway/clojure-bowling/blob/master/src/bowling_game.clj">bowling<sub>game</sub>.clj</a> done by Stuart Halloway's convinced me that Clojure was the way to go compared to the tortuous <a href="http://docentes.uportu.pt/~jmst/Docs/QS/ObjectMentor_XP_episode_test-driven_development.pdf">XP episode</a>.
</p>
<p>
"hammock-driven dev" , "data and functions" and other clojure values appealed strongly to me.
But I had still a long way to go.
</p>
<p>
I missed Christophe Grand at the first MIX-it (May 2011) in Lyon
but I found another clojure enthusiast from Geneva Stephane Tavera who initiated the Clojure Geneva User Group and whose meetups I attended.
</p>
<p>
Then I met @cgrand at Geneva Soft Shake (Sep 2011) and also another clojurian @mpenet.
I had great discussions with both of them and their open-mindness, independence and demanding nature guided me.
</p>
<p>
In 2012 I followed Grand's training in Geneva based on the essential "Clojure Programming" book and he showed me the path towards simplicity.
</p>
<p>
Then @tgkristensen came to Zürich and we started weekly informal clojure meetups.
Yet i was still lacking confidence, Euro clojure (2012) was a frustrating experience :
I was among advanced clojure programmers and I had not completed any Clojure projects yet.
However, I did meet @ngrunwald there, whose deep Computer Science knowledge impressed me.
</p>
<p>
So during the summer I started my own project outside my normal work : the goal having a complete non-intrusive reporting system.
</p>
<p>
The horizon started to clear up and I am firmly decided to embrace fully Clojure ideas.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-1">

<p>For one year I have been following various Massive-Online Learning Programs @udacity @coursera (Finance , BigData , Stats , Algorithms&hellip;) .
My aim is not to get a certificate, but to learn and found these classes as great source of inspiration.

Starting this year 2013, i have the chance to work on my own ideas <a href="http://maxrzepka.github.com/recreation/everything-is-data.html">http://maxrzepka.github.com/recreation/everything-is-data.html</a> and to share them.
For sure I will learn a lot.

<h2 id="sec-8">Future Career</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">


<p>
It will be a new start for me, I'm very excited about the new challenges in Computer Science
and bring along math my first passion to help addressing them.
I will learn a lot, and I'm craving to do so.
</p>
<p>
I know that my future will be a mixture of programming and math. Though I'm open to other possibilities.
</p>
<p>
We are living in such exciting times, where knowledge/ideas can travel without friction.
</p>
<p>
What I need most is human interaction : working with people, sharing the same enthusiasm is crucial.
And equally important is the challenge and the structure for getting things done : I have plenty of ideas and my curiosity can be endless.
</p>
<p>
Therefore I'm looking forward joining your team.
